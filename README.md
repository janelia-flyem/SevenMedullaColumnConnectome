This data was released as part of the 2015 Connectome Hackathon and represents the connectome at a slightly earlier snapshot of our 2015 PNAS [paper](http://www.pnas.org/content/112/44/13711.abstract).  A more up-to-date version of the raw data with segmentation and synapse annotation can be accessed at [https://github.com/janelia-flyem/ConnectomeHackathon2016/wiki/Accessing%20Optic%20Lobe%20Dataset%20using%20Google%20Cloud](https://github.com/janelia-flyem/ConnectomeHackathon2016/wiki/Accessing%20Optic%20Lobe%20Dataset%20using%20Google%20Cloud).

See the [Hackathon Wiki](https://github.com/janelia-flyem/ConnectomeHackathon2015/wiki) for more information including documentation for this repo's data and use cases.

The package includes (see the wiki for more detailed descriptions):
* A directory of skeletons corresponding to the largest neurons in our dataset.  Each file is named by a unique body ID.
* A synapse file that shows how these bodies are connected and the location of the synapese.
* A body description file that provides information about several important body IDs (what is it name, cell type, and other useful information)
